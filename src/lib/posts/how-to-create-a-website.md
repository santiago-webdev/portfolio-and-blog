# How to create a website

This is an index with all the general steps you would normally take to create a
website from scratch, starting with [[basics-of-ui-ux-design]](./basics-of-ui-ux-design)
which will give you a starting point.

Also this is mostly for myself so this guide will not cover basic concepts from
HTML, CSS or JS/TS.

## Where to get inspiration

You'll need inspiration sooner or later for you designs, so head to
[[design-inspiration]](./design-inspiration).
