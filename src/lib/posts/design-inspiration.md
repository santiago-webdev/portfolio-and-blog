You can find good designs in the usual websites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Pinterest](https://ar.pinterest.com/), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/), or [calltoinspiration](https://calltoinspiration.com/). There's also [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/apps?sort=publishedAt) which has iOS, Android and Web specific designs.

For landing page examples there's [lapa](https://www.lapa.ninja/) and [Page Collective](https://pagecollective.com/), which is really cool because it has section for [user flows](https://pageflows.com/?ref=pagecollective).
