I'm still learning, so don't expect this to be the best advice. It's just a summary of what I'm learning along the way.

## Why start designing something?

When you get the feeling of starting a new project or idea, it's usually because:

You have an idea, product, or project you want to pursue. There's a problem you want to solve.

## Who will use your website?

Knowing your target audience is crucial, including their behavior when they land on your website. The UX won't be the same for an elder as for a teenager using your product. You can determine and apply this information to your website through user journeys or user flow diagrams.

Think in terms of routes, screens, steps, or even components on your landing page for your target users to effectively use your website. This step defines the UX.

## Guidelines and Design Systems

Design systems are used to maintain consistency in color and font usage. You can create your own or base it on popular ones like Material Design or Human Interface Guidelines. Sticking with a design system helps you create a cohesive and consistent UI.

## Considerations to Have

Before opening Figma or any design tool, define some general points. Check what could work, find inspiration, and then jump into designing things without having to repeatedly redesign components.

### Fonts

If you are looking for inspiration head to [[font-inspiration]], where I have compiled random fonts that could suit your use-case.

#### Typeface

You normally refer to this types of fonts as _typefaces_, the typeface is the features used to design the set of characters of each font, so you normally separate these fonts in families, the most important ones are:

- Monospaced typefaces: All or most characters have the same width. They are used in code editors, terminals, or to represent snippets of code in HTML since they are easy to distinguish between characters. However, they tend to look unattractive.
- Sans typefaces: Generally old fonts, easily distinguishable by the 'tails', and often used in newspapers.
- Sans-serif typefaces: Everyday modern fonts used by most websites. You can find a clear comparison between Sans and Sans-serif here.

#### Finding Fonts and Font Pairs

Font choices will have a direct impact on the look and feel of your website because each font transmits a different feeling or emotion. For example, if you want to be trendy for a fashion-related website, you should consider using any font variation of Bodoni, which is a very peculiar typeface. You'll notice it's widely used for beauty and fashion products and magazine covers like [Harper's BAZAAR](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/) and [Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/).

Of course, the choice of font largely depends on the target platform and type of website you're creating. However, consider using the system font: San Francisco for Apple products, Segoe UI for Windows computers, Roboto for Android devices, and for Linux or ChromeOS, it could vary, but again, these are basic fonts.

Limit the number of fonts to avoid clutter. Stick to a primary font and maybe a secondary font for UI and body text.

Here are some of my recommendations: For something relatively serious, like a business landing page, you could use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), which is the default font used in Figma, or other Sans fonts like [Uncut Sans](https://uncut.wtf/sans-serif/uncut-sans/) or one of my favorites, [Manrope](https://www.gent.media/manrope). There are also paid fonts like Gilroy and Suisse which are commonly used.

##### Tools for Fonts

In Figma, I've been using two main plugins for creating type scales:

- [Typescales](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739825414752646970/Typescales) to generate the scale.
- [Text Styles Generator](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759472336242530542/Text-Styles-Generator) for generating local text styles.

### Colors

Depending on the rule you choose to use, you need to consider the brand and the feeling it should transmit. This feeling is associated with psychology. For example, if you are making a website for a public auctioneer or a law firm, you should consider using blue as it transmits a sense of seriousness. The color may have already been decided by the brand, so stick to that color to create brand recall.

If you don't have an idea of what you are doing, you can try tools that let you play around with colors and fonts, like [Realtime Colors](https://realtimecolors.com/).

### Accessibility

#### Accessible Font Faces

I always try to do my best to balance looks and accessibility. As you can see from past examples, these designs are bad. Although I understand the reasoning behind the usage of Bodoni typefaces, they were meant to be big. If you find yourself in this situation, try making the fonts as big as possible or choose an appropriate body font.

#### Accessible Fonts

The same applies to colors. There are excellent tools out there to help you manage color palettes while keeping them accessible, such as [Accessible Palette](https://accessiblepalette.com/), which adjusts colors based on human eye perception.
