# The files

To pass data to either +layout.svelte or +page.svelte you do it through the
load() function. Read the [docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#page-data) for
more information.

Note that this is not in order of execution, it's just a general view, if you
want to see the order you can check
[the order in this other post]({base}/blog/execution-order-of-files-in-sveltekit).
