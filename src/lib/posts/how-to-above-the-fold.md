After The Fold (ATF) is a term that comes from newspapers, which you can guess is the place that you first see when you try to read a newspaper, with a screaming sensationalist headline most probably.

This first screen(without scrolling) in your website is premium space, it will determine the stay of new visitors, so it has to answer this questions quickly:

- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- How can you help me?

Normally you balance this between the brand icon(for strong brand recall purposes), the headline, the lead and finally the hero which could be an SVG, an image of your product, or even a mockup of your application like what it happens with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

I have to mention that this will vary depending on the site of course, I've been mentioning landing pages for real state, personal portfolios, services or products which are mostly the same, but if you have an e-commerce website it will greet users with a search bar and promotions or publicity.

## Headline

Try explaining the value that you provide, the USP(Unique Selling Point) if it applies.

For example in the case of my website it's <q>Building the web with clean interfaces</q>, I'm stating that I'm a frontend developer which tries to create good web experiences.

## Lead

The lead is basically the paragraph that follows the headline, and it's what encourages us to continue reading, if the headline grabs the attention, then the lead is responsible for keeping it.

## Call To Action (CTA)

Below the headline you normally follow this up with a "Get started", "Start now", "Quickstart" or similar buttons.
