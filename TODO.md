# TODOs

## Make `Post` a global class

I use `Post` everywhere, and I want to avoid importing it in every component.

## Put the theme switcher outside the hamburger menu

Because you are more likely to need a theme switch every now and then on mobile
devices.

## Style the scrollbar in webkit based browsers

And don't forget to update the reset.css options related to this
