# TODOs

## Make `Post` a global class

I use `Post` everywhere, and I want to avoid importing it in every component.

## Style the scrollbar in webkit based browsers

And don't forget to update the reset.css options related to this

## Add return types to all functions

It's just much clearer to read

## Redo theme switcher

At the moment if you set it to system the next reload of the site will change
the button to either 'light' or 'dark', it should just stay as 'system', maybe
just change the icon.

## Fix font sizing with buttons and anchors

I have to create some kind of style rules for navbars so that they don't get
affect or affect other components.

## Buttons in blog presentation

The buttons show up above the `NavBar` when scrolling

## Make hrs slightly dimmed

Use a muted color for this elements and other details like separators("|", "â€¢")

## Spacing for the entire page

I need to start using a defined width for all components so that the page looks
concise.

## Hamburger menu is enabled

If you middle-click an anchor that page will be loaded with the hamburger menu
enabled even if you are in a desktop.
