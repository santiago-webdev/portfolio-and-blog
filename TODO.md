# TODOs

## Make `Post` a global class

I use `Post` everywhere, and I want to avoid importing it in every component.

## Update the link if it stays in a section for too long

If the viewport is seeing let's say #projects for more than 5 seconds update the
link to include that without modifying the view.

## Redo the navbar

**Once again** redo the navbar, the code is unreadable.

## For the scroll tracker

Make it smooth and put it in the sidebar in the desktop

## Improve navigation in modal box

For the search modal box, close it when using the back arrow in the browser. And
also add keyboard navigation with arrow keys.

## Fix intersiction observer for button to top and navigation

It's not being updated to the current <main> after navigation, so it's ignored.

## Fix slide classes not working
