# TODOs

## Make `Post` a global class

I use `Post` everywhere, and I want to avoid importing it in every component.

## Add return types to all functions

It's just much clearer to read

## Update the link if it stays in a section for too long

If the viewport is seeing let's say #projects for more than 5 seconds update the
link to include that without modifying the view.

## Redo the navbar

**Once again** redo the navbar, the code is unreadable.

## More minimalistic buttons for `Hero`

And maybe include some nice animation.

## For the scroll tracker

Make it smooth and put it in the sidebar in the desktop

## Improve navigation in modal box

For the search modal box, close it when using the back arrow in the browser.
