# TODOs

## Make `Post` a global class

I use `Post` everywhere, and I want to avoid importing it in every component.

## Add return types to all functions

It's just much clearer to read

## Hamburger menu is enabled

If you middle-click an anchor that page will be loaded with the hamburger menu
enabled even if you are in a desktop.

## Update the link if it stays in a section for too long

If the viewport is seeing let's say #projects for more than 5 seconds update the
link to include that without modifying the view.
